# Yet Another Simple Config Language (YSCL)

YSCL (rhymes with "Haskell" and "rascal") is a simple config language that anyone can learn in five minutes.

It's focus is on extreme simplicity and readability.

YSCL files end with the `.yscl` extension.

## Learn

Please read [CRASH_COURSE.md](./learn/CRASH_COURSE.md).

## Parser implementations

- Rust: [yscl-rs](https://crates.io/crates/yscl)
- TypeScript/JavaScript: Coming soon...maybe (depends on demand). If someone is interested, let me know. Open an [issue](https://github.com/kylejlin/yscl/issues/new), and I will be happy to help you.
- Same goes for Go, C++, Java, Ruby, Python, etc.
- If you implemented a parser yourself, that would be even better!
  You can open an [issue](https://github.com/kylejlin/yscl/issues/new) and I will a link to this list.
  I will also add you to the contributors list (which currently doesn't exist since it's just me ðŸ˜€).
